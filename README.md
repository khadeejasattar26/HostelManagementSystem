# Hostel Management System

## Overview

We created a basic level Hostel Management System using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Our system, implemented in Java, integrates SQL for backend data storage and JavaFX for the frontend interface.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Add, delete, display, and search records.
- **OOP Concepts**: Utilized encapsulation, inheritance, exception handling, abstraction, composition, enums, and wrapper classes.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core language for backend functionality.
- **SQL**: Database management for persistent storage.
- **JavaFX**: Framework for building the user interface.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - JDK (Java Development Kit)
   - MySQL (or any preferred SQL database)

2. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Import the project into your IDE.

3. **Run**:
   - Compile and execute the main class to launch the application.

## Future Enhancements

We're proud of what we've accomplished and look forward to enhancing the system with additional features in the future.
